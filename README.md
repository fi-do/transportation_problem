## About the Project

There are many great algorithm out there to solve a transport problem.
However, i started to write my own module to find a potential solution and get a better understanding in impementing
algorithmen in code.

## Getting Started

My goal is to release a simple python module to calculate potential and optimal solutions. So clone the main.py to
your python library folder and get started.

### Requirements

You need:
* Python > 3.6
* numpy library
* math library

### Installation
WIP

## Usage
Implement the module. Create an object with demand, supply and cost informations and call one methode to find a solution.
